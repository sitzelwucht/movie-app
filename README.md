# Movie App

## Installation

Install dependencies by running ```npm i``` separately in client and server folders. 

## General

This app allows user to search for movies using  [The Movie DB API](https://https://themoviedb.org), series and people with separate searches, and displays list of results dynamically. Clicking on results opens an info box with a poster/profile image related to the target of search.

User can create an account, after which they can add titles to their watchlist (separate ones for movies and series).
